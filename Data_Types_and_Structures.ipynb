        "4. Use Cases\n",
        "List: Best when you need a collection that can change — for example, a shopping cart or task list.\n",

        "Tuple: Ideal for fixed collections of items — like coordinates (x, y), or days of the week.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Methods\n",
        "Lists have more built-in methods like .append(), .remove(), .sort(), etc.\n",

        "Tuples have very few methods — mainly .count() and .index().\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Can Be Used as Dictionary Keys\n",
        "Tuples (if they contain only immutable elements) can be used as dictionary keys.\n",

        "**Q4:-Describe how dictionaries store data?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**In Python, dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a value. Dictionaries are also called hash maps or associative arrays in other languages.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**You might use a set instead of a list in Python when you need to store unique items and perform fast membership tests. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. No Duplicates Allowed\n",
        "A set automatically removes duplicates.\n",
        "\n",

Starting from Python 3.7+, dictionaries do preserve insertion order, but they are still conceptually unordered in terms of how they store data internally using a hash table.\n",

        "Keys are hashed to determine where their values are stored in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "Dictionaries did not maintain insertion order.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python 3.7 and Above\n",
        "Insertion order is preserved, so the items appear in the order they were added.\n",
